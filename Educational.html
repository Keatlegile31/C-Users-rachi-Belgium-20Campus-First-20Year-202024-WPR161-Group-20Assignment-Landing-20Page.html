            <h2>Impact of Gender-Based Violence</h2>
            <p>Gender-based violence (GBV) has profound effects on both individuals and society as a whole. Here are some of the key impacts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> GBV can result in severe physical injuries, chronic health conditions, and even death. Survivors may experience long-term health consequences, including disability and chronic pain.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> GBV often leads to psychological trauma, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal thoughts. Survivors may struggle with low self-esteem, feelings of shame, and difficulty trusting others.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Survivors of GBV may withdraw from social interactions, relationships, and community involvement due to fear, stigma, and shame. This isolation can exacerbate mental health issues and hinder recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Consequences:</strong> GBV can have significant financial repercussions, including loss of income, employment opportunities, and economic independence. Survivors may face barriers to accessing education, housing, and other resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpersonal Relationships:</strong> GBV can strain relationships with family members, friends, and romantic partners. Survivors may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining healthy connections due to trust issues and emotional scars.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Impact:</strong> GBV perpetuates cycles of violence and undermines community cohesion. It contributes to social inequality, discrimination, and human rights violations, eroding trust in institutions and fostering a culture of impunity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Addressing GBV requires comprehensive strategies that prioritize survivor support, prevention efforts, and systemic change. By raising awareness, promoting gender equality, and holding perpetrators accountable, we can work towards a society free from gender-based violence.</p>
