<h3>In His Own Words - Luyanda Botha - How I Killed Uyinene Mrwetyana</h3>
<h2 style="color: red;">WARNING:This story contains graphic descriptions of rape and murder</h2>
<h3>Former Post Office Teller Admits to Rape and Murder of UCT Student</h3>
<p>By TimesLIVE Staff Reporter</p>
<p>"I, Luyanda Botha, was employed as a teller at the Clarenreich Post Office in Claremont. I first interacted with the deceased on 8 August 2019 when she entered Clarenreich Post Office to enquire about a parcel she was expecting. The parcel contained clothing she had purchased online.</p>
<p>"The parcel was not available and I told the deceased I would contact her to tell her when the parcel was available.
The parcel arrived at the post office on 16 August 2019. I registered the parcel on the same day.</p>
<p>"On Saturday 24 August 2019 I reported for duty at Clarenreich Post Office. The post office was due to close at 13h00. Shortly before 13h00 my colleague, Soraya Abdullah, went home as per an agreement between us, leaving me alone in the post office.
    I contacted the deceased to inform her the parcel was available for collection.</p>
<p>"The deceased used the Taxify taxi service to travel from her residence, Roscommon, university student accommodation in Claremont, to the Clarenreich Post Office. She arrived at the post office after closing time.
    I unlocked the front door and the deceased entered. When she entered the post office, we were alone in a locked post office.</p>
<p>"When the deceased searched her bag to pay the requisite customs fees, I started making sexual advances towards her.
    The deceased did not respond and looked scared. I grabbed her by the waist and forcibly pulled her closer to me.</p>
<p>"I proceeded to sexually touch the deceased against her will. I inserted my fingers into her vagina. I then inserted my penis into her vagina.
    The deceased fought me whilst I sexually violated her.
    She managed to run to the door but I caught up with her and knocked her to the ground.
    I dragged the deceased to the safe inside the post office. I locked her up inside the safe. The deceased screamed while inside the safe.
    I choked the deceased and she fought back and kicked me".</p>
<p>"I took a 2kg weight, used to weigh the packages received at the post office, and used it to bludgeon the deceased to death. I targeted her head.
    I left the post office and consumed alcohol outside a nearby liquor outlet.
    I returned to the post office shortly thereafter. I covered the body of the deceased with cushions, a blanket and a jersey as she lay in the safe.
    I left the post office in the evening.
    I returned to the post office in the early hours of Sunday 25 August 2019. The area where I attacked the deceased and where her body lay was covered in the blood of the deceased.</p>
<p>I proceeded to clean up the inside of the post office to remove the blood from the scene.
    I waited until it was dark and requested the security officer, who patrolled the outside perimeter of post office, to allow me to park my motor vehicle in the yard of the post office.
    Once parked in the yard, I placed the body of the deceased in a large postal mail bag and carried her body to the motor vehicle. I transported the body of the deceased to a field in Lingelethu-West and dumped it in a shallow hole.
    I then drove to a nearby petrol station and purchased petrol.</p>
    <p>"I returned to where I disposed of the body of the deceased, doused her with petrol and set her alight. I admit I did so to defeat or obstruct the course of justice by destroying forensic evidence. I admit I hired someone to clean my car to destroy forensic evidence.
        I admit the body of the deceased was discovered on Monday 26 August 2019. I admit she was correctly identified as Uyinene Mrwteyana."

                <h3>Karabo Mokoena - Not Just A Hashtag</h3>      
                <h2 style="color: red;">WARNING:This story contains graphic descriptions of murder</h2>   
 <p>Hours before her murder on April 27, Karabo Mokoena had a heated argument with her boyfriend in a Sandton nightclub that deteriorated into a physical fight.
    The couple left the club together. She was never seen alive again.</p>     
 <p>The part-time business student's body was found in a patch of veld in Bramley, Johannesburg, two days later by a passer-by who at first thought the body was a burnt mannequin.
    Karabo had been necklaced and had had acid poured over her body. She was burnt beyond recognition.</p>     
 <p>The 22-year-old's death has sparked national outrage and made international news following the arrest of her boyfriend. Twenty-seven-year-old Sandile Mantsoe has been charged with premeditated murder and defeating the ends of justice.
    Police sources said Mantsoe, a forex trader, claimed he left Karabo in the apartment after their argument and upon his return found his girlfriend of seven months dead.   
    "He claims that he doesn't know who killed her, but that he panicked and believed people would think he killed her," said the source.</p>     
 <p>He is said to have told police how he disposed of her body.
    "He said he stuffed her body into a bin, rolled it out and into his gold BMW and drove to his family home in Lyndhurst, in southern Johannesburg. He picked up a tyre, acid and a container and drove to a filling station to buy petrol, which he used to douse Karabo's body in Bramley, where he buried her body."</p>     
 <p>CCTV footage from Mantsoe's apartment, seen by her family, shows Karabo and Mantsoe arriving at the flat after 1am. Shortly thereafter Mantsoe leaves the apartment in different clothes.
    He comes back to the house and then leaves again. He returns with a bin. The footage shows Mantsoe and two other women leaving the house with plastic bags that seem to be filled with sheets. Mantsoe leaves the house with the body at around 2pm.</p>     
 <p>Yesterday Karabo's father, Thabang Mokoena, fought back tears as he told of the conversation he had with his daughter's boyfriend the day after she went missing.
    "This boy has always been respectful, to the last day I spoke to him on the phone and he was lying to me.    
    "I called him the day she went missing and he agreed that we should meet on the Saturday. When the day came he told me he was at a funeral in Mpumalanga.</p>     
 <p>"I couldn't work or eat for days looking for her. I kept telling my colleagues something bad had happened, I could feel it. But I couldn't go to the morgues to search for her, it was too painful."
    The brutal crime has given rise to the a hashtag #MenAreTrash as scores of women shared stories on social media of abuse at the hands of men, and reignited the debate on femicide.  
    Since January, several cases have been reported of South African women killed or raped by their boyfriends, husbands or other men close to them.  
    This week details of Karabo's abusive relationship with Mantsoe emerged. Cases of assault had been opened with police by both parties in the past.</p>

    Since January, several cases have been reported of South African women killed or raped by their boyfriends, husbands or other men close to them.  
    This week details of Karabo's abusive relationship with Mantsoe emerged. Cases of assault had been opened with police by both parties in the past.</p>     
 <p>Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said: "The deceased and her boyfriend opened counter-charges of common assault. A statement had already been obtained from the boyfriend. The incident of murder happened while the investigation was continuing. Both cases have been taken to the prosecutor for a decision."
    But a highly placed source said that when Karabo tried to open her case against her boyfriend, police officers at the station told the two to "work it out" because they could not be investigating counter-claims.</p>     
 <p>Karabo's younger brother, Lebogang, said he was shocked earlier this year when his sister showed him a picture of her bruised and battered face.
    "We only got to see the ugly side of the relationship this year when she showed me the pictures of her bruised face. I was so sad and we agreed she would go to the cops. At some stage she started to feel sorry for this guy but I told her not to and open a case against him," he said.</p>     
 <p>Less than a month later his sister went missing.
    "As we looked for her my dad couldn't take it anymore and broke down. He's a very strong man. He was in his room and I could hear him weeping."    
    Karabo's cousin Boipelo said Mantsoe was a very likeable guy who never disrespected Karabo in front of the family or friends.
    "But that's the nature of abusive relationships, where it's hidden. Recently Karabo told us about the abuse and that she wanted to get out. She started her work with abused women after her own attack," she said.</p>     
 <p>Karabo's family reported her missing on April 28, the day after the nightclub fight. Her body was found on April 29. Mantsoe was arrested this Thursday.
    Captain Mavela Masondo said police had not immediately connected the missing-person case with the body.   
    "At the time we did not connect the two as they were investigated by two different police stations, Diepkloof and Sandringham. Right now we can't say what tipped us off to arrest the boyfriend but we were able to link the disappearance to Mantsoe," he said.  
    On Thursday, Karabo's uncle, Tshepo Mokoena, wrote on Facebook: "The boyfriend confessed. He killed and burnt my daughter."</p>
